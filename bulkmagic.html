      <p>
        Online marketplaces face significant challenges when onboarding sellers.
        The process is often long, confusing, and filled with compliance requirements
        that vary by location — leading to frustration, drop-offs, and operational risk.
      </p>

  <!-- Problem -->
  <section>
    <div class="section-inner">
      <div class="label">Problem</div>

      <p>Sellers struggled with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Navigating lengthy, confusing onboarding processes</li>
        <li>Understanding which documents were required (W-9s, tax permits, licenses)</li>
        <li>Meeting federal and state compliance requirements across multiple states</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        For BulkMagic, incomplete or incorrect submissions increased manual review effort
        and introduced compliance risk.

  <!-- Solution -->
  <section>
  <div class="section-inner">
    <div class="label">Solution</div>

    <p>
      I designed a personalized, step-by-step onboarding flow that adapts to each seller’s
      business structure and location, reducing cognitive load and guiding them toward
      successful completion.
    </p>

    <!-- Feature 1 -->
    <h3>Progressive disclosure</h3>
    <p>
      The onboarding begins by understanding the seller’s business structure and locations
      of operation. Only fields and documents relevant to their inputs appear in later steps,
      preventing unnecessary complexity.
    </p>

      alt="Progressive disclosure in seller onboarding flow"
    />

    <!-- Feature 2 -->
    <h3>Dynamic document checklists</h3>
    <p>
      A personalized checklist dynamically updates based on seller inputs,
      clearly communicating which documents are required at each stage.
    </p>

      alt="Dynamic document checklist adapting to seller inputs"
    />

    <!-- Feature 3 -->
    <h3>Bulk upload hub</h3>
    <p>
      Sellers can upload multiple documents at once—such as W-9 forms,
      tax permits, and business licenses—reducing repetitive actions and errors.
    </p>

      alt="Bulk document upload interface for seller onboarding"
    />

    <!-- Feature 4 -->
    <h3>Automated validation</h3>
    <p>
      Real-time validation checks submissions against federal and state
      compliance requirements, including physical and economic nexus thresholds.
    </p>

    />

    <!-- Feature 5 -->
    <h3>Save & resume</h3>
    <p>
      Sellers can save their progress and return later,
      making long onboarding flows more forgiving and reducing abandonment.

  <!-- Challenges addressed -->
  <section>
    <div class="section-inner">
      <div class="label">Key challenges addressed</div>

      <h3>Complex compliance requirements</h3>
      <p>
        Sellers must comply with varying federal and state tax laws,
        including physical and economic nexus thresholds.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Design response:</strong>  
        Personalized checklists ensured sellers submitted only the documents
        relevant to their situation.
      </p>

      <h3>Seller frustration and drop-off</h3>
      <p>
        Long, unclear onboarding flows often lead to abandonment.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Design response:</strong>  
        Clear step-by-step progression, helper text, and bulk upload options
        reduced friction and cognitive load.
      </p>

      <h3>Document management and validation</h3>
      <p>
        Sellers struggled to track which documents were missing or incorrect.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Design response:</strong>  
        A unified upload hub with real-time validation and error handling
        ensured all required documents were collected correctly.

      <div class="label">Reflection</div>

      <p>
        This project reinforced how quickly onboarding complexity compounds
        in compliance-heavy systems. Small design decisions —
        such as when to ask for information and how clearly expectations are framed —
        can significantly impact completion rates and trust.
